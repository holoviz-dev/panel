/**
 * Client-side registry for external component resources.
 *
 * Both the eager path (`pn.extension`, which renders its script and link
 * tags into the page and then calls `declare`) and the lazy path (a model
 * carrying an `external_resources` spec, which calls `ensure`) write to one
 * registry, so a library is fetched at most once per page no matter how
 * many components, documents or Panel versions ask for it.
 *
 * The registry is installed on `globalThis.__panel_resources__`, outside any
 * version-namespaced object, so two Panel versions sharing a JupyterLab page
 * share it as well. Its shape is therefore a cross-version contract: it
 * carries a `v` field and must stay minimal and backwards compatible.
